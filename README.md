# Java-HashMap
## we are using java to create a simple fun game using hashmap 
we first created a hashMap with key as east african countries and values as their capital cities. so the user will be asked to input
any east african country in order to get its capital city
#### the program will first check if the given country is in east african countries then if it's included it will print out it's capital 
otherwise it will let u know that the country u entered doesn't belong in east african countries
